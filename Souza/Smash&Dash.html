        <p>
        In this project, I was tasked with creating an app on any subject that incorporated a mapping system. So I created Smash&Dash.
        </p>
        <p>
        Smash&Dash is an app designed for Super Smash Bros. players to meet up face-to-face and play together. Each player can choose their 'main' character they primarily play as and set their level of play. They can also rate other players that they have battled against so that future players can get a feel for what kind of player they are. Finally, each player can chat and agree to meet up which would reveal their location so that the other player may find them via a GPS system within the app.
